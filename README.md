# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier  ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning-based **Email Spam Classifier** that accurately identifies whether a given email is spam or not.  
Built using the **UCI Machine Learning Spam Dataset**, the project involves key stages like data cleaning, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and upcoming deployment on Heroku.

## âœ… Project Progress & Tasks

### 1. ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ âœ… Completed  
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Checked for missing/null values  
- Visualized spam vs. non-spam class distribution  
- Analyzed word frequency and message lengths

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Text Preprocessing â€“ âœ… Completed  
- Converted text to lowercase  
- Removed punctuation, stopwords, and special characters  
- Applied tokenization and lemmatization  
- Transformed text into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**

### 3. ðŸ¤– Model Training & Evaluation â€“ âœ… Completed  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained multiple models: **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **SVM**  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**  
- Final model selected based on best overall performance
